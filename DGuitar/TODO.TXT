THINGS TODO
----------------------------------
/ Unify the playButton and playPanel of all windows on a playToolbar
	X When switching between songs keep the title of the song being played
	X Allow only a single song to be played 
		
	X STOP song even if the song is ICONIFIED

	X show the information of the current selected frame
	X SongInternalFrame
	X MidiInternalFrame
	X the playToolbar should display the name of the song is linked to
	X When all windows are closed..reset labels of playToolBar to "empty" and hide them

	X playToolbar should either switch to a STOP button
		X create a STOP button (b2.gif) 
		X use it when the PLAY button is selected 
	X I18N of this strings at PLAY PANEL
		X "Song" 
		X "Measure" 
		X "Beat"
		X "Division" 
		
	- When any music cursor is moved (by clicking), the playPanel should display its location
		- this includes the name of the last clicked TRACK
	- when song is MIDI...either:
		- hide the Measure,Bar,Division labels
		- show correct info on them
		
- detect if is the first launch and ask the user if he wants to configure the main settings
	- select the language
	- select the skin
	- selecting the midi device
	- Ask for user email to register DGuitar (should it be validated -- activate email link ?)
		- this will allow to perform surveys later
		- this email will be used when sending report of errors and usage statistics
			
	- allow it to choose if he wants to report statistics of usage and telemetry (checked by default)
		- menu options selected (count)
		- performance 
			- time to startup
			- time to load files
			- time to adapt files
		- detect double clicks and right clicks (even on places components where is not used for anything)
		- detect keys pressed	
		
	- allow user to choose if the wants to report errors
		- always report errors (default)
			- attach file that caused error (checked by default)

	- use/finish developing the wizard classes of the Common package
    - Store all the selected preferences in the DGuitar.properties file
     	- Include the Preferred midi device 
     	- Including an option that says that is no longer the first launch 
     	
/ Let the user select which midi device he would like to use (Midi Preferences)
	/ enable the button for "Set midi device"
		/ test it under JRE 1.5 (JRE 1.5 is still not available for MacOs !!)
		- test it under JRE 1.4 (does not provide a method for this ?)
	X test what happens when all devices do NOT have receivers
		this means that all devices are for capturing but not for playing
				

    
- Add URLS to the recently open files list 

/ SLIDES
	X The width depends on the Beat Width
	- a SLIDE can join a note on the beat 1 with a note on the beat 3
	- Slides go on a SEPARATE LAYER since it can join beats on different measures
		see	TrackPanel.java (TrackPanel method)
	X create the index method for the Slide types
	X depending on the IndexNumber the EON Label will be GIF or custom PAINTED
	X The setAnchor position for SLIDE_IN_* objects is not working fine.
	- adjust the getPoint method to set the EXACT location
	- the width of the slide must me narrow (depends on the width of the fret)
	- The inclination of SLIDE_SHIFT and SLIDE_LEGATO depends on the 
	  NextFret on the same string..like this..
		if (NextFret >= currentFret)
			"/"
		else
			"\" 

/ DISPLAY All other Effects On NoteS (EONs)
    - hammer/pulls are always draw after the current beat.
	- grace notes to the left of origin note
    / there are other bend types, besides the 5 types that are now shown
    / the horizontal line that connects the vertical rhythm lines (more testing)
    	- when beats contain silences...horizontal rhythm lines are showing 
		(see blue.gp4)
		
- LOG WINDOW
	- When the DGuitar Main Window is minimized, minimize the LOG window TOO
	- When the LOG WINDOW is Closed allow it to be close and uncheck the LOG IS...SHOWN ON A WINDOW

- When the DGUITAR_LOG close buttons is pressed perform one of these :
    1. the close operation of the main window (that asks for saving as necessary)
	2. close the LOG WINDOW, set the menu option and save the contents to LOG file

- Palm Mute notes that have a 28.0% occurrence (higher than SLIDES 18.0% see EFFECTS.txt)
	- Understand how they are displayed and complexity of implementing it

- a SAVE option when the file been open from HTTP (or other Internet protocol)
	save the byte sequence, no need to change CODECS for now

- Allow user to manage favorites (a list of different path for files, ie bookmarks)

- Fix the the -1 values when displaying fret
	"i get some -1 values in the tab where i guess there are pauses or stopped notes"
	"I'm fairly certain that the -1 denotes a string that should be muted.

/ add this Windows operations : (see DGDesktopPane)
	X Close all windows
	/ Cascade, (more testing)
	- Tab Layout (arrange windows in tabs)
	- Grid Layout (arrange windows in a matrix)
	- Tile Horiz
	- Tile Vert
	- minimize all (or selected ones)
	- restore all (or selected ones)

/ Work on the visual playing of a Score
	X move all musicCursor syncronized
	X When the music is auto-scrolled, the bars are now refreshed correclty 
	X how to perform the automatic horizontal scrolling 
	- When the cursor goes back before the actual measure, the scrolling is not going back as expected
	- When the BARS are really wide..the forward scrolling happens before the MusicCursor has moved

/ The MIDI events are not showing correct info (see emails from Chris arround March 06-2005)

/ create and option called "enable unfinished features" so user can decide if he wants to see/test this...
	X create the menu check box and I18N text
	- Store the "enable unfinished features" on preferences file
	X DISPLAY OPTIONS for all songs
	- SLIDES
	- Printing

- Provide a method for opening a ZIP file that contains FILES of supported extensions
	- MySongBook and many other people distribute songs in Zip format
	- this will allow to actually open a file direclty from the internet

- create an option to compare to MIDI files...
	Example of use:
	
	from a single GP file two MIDIs can be created:
		1. from a the original GuitarPro program
		2. from the current DGuitar player
	In this way the differences can be reduced and the playback improved

- "Realistic Sound" anyone up for the challenge ?
	Midi sound can be improved..but its still not as good as other tools : 
		SweetGuitar or Real Sound Engine provide a more realistic sound

----------------------------------
THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
----------------------------------

/ The colors options should also be available from the DGuitar menus, 
	 - allow user to change colors to all (open) pieces ..see SongAction methods  ;
	 X create/test a setDisplayOptions method at SongPanel
	 / create/test a setDisplayOptions method at SongInternalFrame
	 - when a ColorDialog is open it should alse refresh those colors
	 - call validate on SongPanel
	 - store the display Preferences in the DGuitar.properties

- Create installer for DGuitar to avoid people having to manually type commands
	- installer should
		- Create Desktop Icon (for Windows, Mac and Linux)
		- Show Readme (with the tipical checkbox marked)
		- Launch the program after installation (which runs first time wizard)
		
- Drag and Drop DOES NOT WORK using KDE konqueror (problems are reported by at least one user)
	- test with other Linux File Explorers (with the FileExplorer of GNOME it works)

- The minimum size of this windows needs to be set for:
	- DGuitar LOG WINDOW 
	- Color Options
	- test other windows

- Playing a Large GP file has a poor perfomance/timing
	---------------------------------------------------------
	TITLE OF THE SONG			Complete adapting process time
	---------------------------------------------------------
	Metallica - Solos Of Metallica.gp4 	248 KB/256 seconds
	Opeth - Deliverance.gp4  		165 KB/166 seconds
	Hotel California.gp3			62 KB/14 seconds

	OPTIONS:
	A) estimate the time to Adapt the song and display a INFORMATION window if its too long 
	B) use the ProgressBar with a SwingWorker, that pops-up after a FIXED time

	- Under LINUX FEDORA 3 its sound cropped, more tests
	- PLAYing a SONG for the second time is not fast (re-adapting is required at this moment)

- Change the width of the MusicCursor when its a whole beat, 
	its crossing the Measure number (no complaints, but..)

- see HTTP-ERROR.txt for a Random error that has happend on my computer..not reported by anybody else
		
- AutoScroll of DGuitar LOG window (no complaints, but expected/usefull)

---------------------
CODEC TASKS
---------------------
  - check the chords version 3 in version 4 files
	  - FILE: "Dimanche Matin Soleil.gp4" COULD NOT BE OPEN

		ERROR:  GP4decoder.GP4FormatException: 
			Chord Diagrams are in GP3 format
			Which are not documented
	
	    The readChordDiagram from GP3Decoder was used but it did not work

  - check the chord diagram in version 4 at the end of file
	  
  - check additional bytes at the end in files from version 3 or 4.

  - decode the version 1 (we will be able to open any guitar pro file)
      
  - wideVibrato and FadeIn are undocumented (on the GuitarPro format description)

-------------------
PLAYBACK TASKS
-------------------
 
- Adjustable tempo for playback 	

- Ability to mute channels

- Ability to adjust volume of each channel

---------------

- create a DGIterator that allows to create a list of GTP files/folders and then perform different actions
	- plays them.
	- exports them to MIDI
	- export from GPx to GPy (x,y = [1,2,3,4])
	
	This DGIterator should ALSO work as an external tool that does not need DGuitar GUI.

- when the Color options are disabled...the MiniPanel color should be changed to gray 
	(disabling the buttons visually)

- when the view is MultiTab view, provide an option that moves the scroll bars simultaneously (when not playing)

- windows that are open from the PieceInternalFrame 
	- should be added to the destkop ?? or a Dialog (as no-modal, with parent)?

- GUI methods should be dependent of Abstract clases like SCORE,TRACK and so on
	- not linked direclty to GP4* classes
	- Design and created GUI components for the information that GTP4Decoder can read       
	    - Track information
	    - Other information (Tempo, Key, Octave,MixTableChange)

- BARS should know when is required to relocate the EON LABELS 
	- to avoid unnecessary call to paintEffects and improve repainting methods.
	- when the TOOLtip is show and then hidden, JAVA calls repaint on the objects that were covered

- Improve the way the Strings of MENUS are handled
	- abstract class java.util AbstractMap:
	allows to link one Object with Another :
		link StringKeys of menus with Integer of the menu IDs, consider HOT-KEY binding

	this should allow to use MENU_PROGRAM instead of "MENU_PROGRAM" when I18N
	- this can be used to evalute wich menu options was clicked.
